            Consider the repository-list.txt and branched-7-repository-list.txt files are automatically generated by the [build-chain-files-generator tool](https://github.com/kiegroup/build-chain-files-generator)[1]. You shouldn't modifiy those files directly but the one from [.ci/project-dependencies.yaml](https://github.com/kiegroup/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/blob/master/.ci/project-dependencies.yaml)[2]
