            Please, consider the repository-list.txt and branched-7-repository-list.txt files are automatically generated by the [build-chain-files-generator tool][1]. You shouldn't modifiy those files directly but the one from [.ci/project-dependencies.yaml][2].

            Thanks a lot for your contribution and sorry for the inconveniences,
            Kie team.
